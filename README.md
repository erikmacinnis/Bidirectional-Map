# Bidirectional-Map

* School Project
* This is a Map made up of Rooms (nodes) which are connected together via north, east, west, and south gates.
* I created a Room class that is composed of an all the rooms and an iterator to loop over a Room type with an enhanced for loop.
* I created the BidirectionalMap class which extends the MazeMap class. This class creates and links multiple rooms to create the map.
* I created the saveToFile method in the MazeMap class which saves all the possible rooms and gates accessible in the Maze.
* I created the noKeySolution method in the MazeMap class which finds a route from the start to finish of the maze using a recursive helper function I created called findNextRoom.
* The rest of the project was created by the professor
